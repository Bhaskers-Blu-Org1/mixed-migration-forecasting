# mixed-migration-forecasting

The Foresight system (previously Mixed Migration Forecasting) is a forecasting system for the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) aimed at providing long term forecasts on forced displacement volumes and causal analysis of drivers of displacement. 

This repository contains code assets related to data aggregation, machine learning and bayesian network learning, and user interface components. It is organized in two separate applications. 

* `server`  - Contains data aggregation, model generation, APIs. See [README.md](server/README.md)
* `ui` - responsible for data visualisation, user-managment, report handling unit of a system. See [README](ui/README.md)
